# fedsafe

![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ritschmaster/fedsafe/total)

Easy security for new and novice Fedora users

## Features

1. Disposable sandboxes for applications that might require disposable sandboxes
    1. Those should behave similarly to the Disposable Virtual Machine feature present in Qubes OS but much more lightweight.
    2. The following applications are available: 
      1. Firefox
      2. Evince
      3. Libreoffice Writer
      4. Libreoffice Calc 
    3. Disposable sandboxes for arbitary applications are a low priority TODO
2. Sandboxes for important applications
    1. Those are heavily restricted applications still utilizing the local filesystem. They are a balance of running an application in a disposable sandbox and running them without any restrictions at all.
    2. The following applications are available: 
      1. Firefox
      2. Telegram
      3. Hexchat
3. Setup sane security defaults
    1. Setup to actually allow using sandboxes by SELinux
      1. Currently only available as description
    2. `hidepid=2`

fedsafe does not aim to replace the use case of Qubes OS. Instead it enables its ideas on a plain Fedora (like) system. That way it allows usability-friendly features like suspend-to-disk, accessing all files at once in a secure way.

Generally you will want to setup the following on your system:
1. A keyboard shortcut performing `fedsafe box clipboard_copy` (e.g. on <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>)
2. A keyboard shortcut performing `fedsafe box clipboard_paste` (e.g. on <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>)
